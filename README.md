This is the classical Markowitz MVO framework. 
The code works for stocks listed in the US (by default), UK, Germany, and France. It includes most of user-error handlings.
If a ticker is missing or incorrectly entered, the code will issue a warning, and then ignore it (no crash & no impact on the code).
